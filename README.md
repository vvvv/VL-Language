# VL-Language Design
The official repo for the design of the VL programming language 

Welcome to the official repo for VL language design. This is where new features get tested and specified. The language is designed by the VL language design team of the vvvv group. https://visualprogramming.net/ 

This repository is here to close a communication gap. We want to tell you about our ideas regarding the language VL and we want to get feedback from you.
As language features of a visual language have to be supported by the tool (vvvv) we will at times discuss the UI of the patch editor. The main focus of this repository however is the language. We don't want to discuss IDE features in here to not lose track.
