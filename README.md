# VL-Language Design
Welcome to the official repo for VL language design. This is where new features get discussed and specified. The language is designed by the VL language design team of the vvvv group. https://visualprogramming.net/ 

This repository is here to close a communication gap. We want to tell you about our ideas regarding the language VL and we want to get feedback from you.
As language features of a visual language have to be supported by the tool (vvvv) we will at times discuss the UI of the patch editor. The main focus of this repository however is the language. We don't want to discuss IDE features in here to not lose track.

Please note that this repository is about language ideas, not the implementation and its potential bugs. However, we do allow reports about conceptual problems, where language features are hard to combine. 

We understand that language design isn't just about coming up with as many different ways of expression as possible, but about simple ways of expression and elegant ideas, which can be combined well.

Before you open a new issue:
Please consider to split up your idea into
* Motivation. Start the issue title with `[Quest]`
* Your proposed solution. Start the issue title with `[Proposal]` and refer to your quest.

Our workflow will then look like this:
* prioritize certain quests
* figure out which proposal to accept `[Decision]` either because 
   * it fits best (the right hammer that solves one particular problem)  
   * since it's such a general-purpose idea that solves different quests 
* prioritize the decisions   
* actually implement those
